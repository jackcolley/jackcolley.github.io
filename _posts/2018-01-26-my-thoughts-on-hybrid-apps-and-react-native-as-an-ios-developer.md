title: "My Thoughts On Hybrid Apps And React Native As An iOS Developer"

Let me start by clarifying what I mean here. I'm talking about building apps with tools like React Native. I'd also like to note that these are all my thoughts. You might disagree with me or think I've missed a vital part. Either way @jackcolley on Twitter if you want to open a discussion.

## My Problems With React Native

So, React Native ... What gives?

For those of you that don't know what React Native is, its a tool developed by Facebook that enables you to write your mobile apps once with Javascript and have it build into both iOS and Android applications. Its based on the React javascript framework (hence the name) and it promises great things.

React Native has long been considered the best of hybrid app technologies, with a lot of companies jumping on it. 

Sounds great right? ...

Well, the idea is great. Save time by only building your shiny new feature once. Re-use complicated business logic between both apps. The list of benefits goes on and on. However, in principle when it actually comes down to building your first app. You're going to hit a learning curve. That learning curve is quite steep. However, over time, if you stick with it then obviously the benefit will pay off. I stuck with it and managed to get to a point where I was comfortable using React Native for small side projects and test apps. I'm sure if I had spent more time working on it that it would have become a part of my worlflow / a tool I use daily.

However, my biggest problem with React Native is that its not stable yet. There are big changes and they happen frequently. I know that is to be expected when you're using a tool that has a massive developer community and hasn't become stable yet. But to support a long term project on React Native in an agency environment would be a nightmare. If you were developing a product continuously, then I think you could just about get away with it. But in an agency setting where you release a version and then might not come back to it for another 6 months. That simply just wouldn't work. The start of every version would be spent updating to the latest version and that would become costly.

## React Native Success Stories

A true indication that this is technology that is going to stick around is the fact that it has been adopted by Facebook (obviously), AirBnB and Uber Eats. Especially with Uber Eats having written their entire app in React Native. As mentioned above, the one thing that all of these apps have in common is the fact that they are continuously developed products. The development work never stops. Theyy are also products as opposed to agency work. 

## Should I learn React Native or wait until its stable?

I would definitely say have a look into it and try it out for a few small side projects or MVP's. I do see the benefits in React Native but until its stable, I wouldn't use it for anything more. I might also be slighty bias towards native applications as thats my job.

## What about agencies?

I think 2018 is going to be a very interesting year for React Native and hybrid apps. Multi-platform Kotlin is just starting to get talked about and work its way into the ecosystem. This could be another game changer. But certainly in the next few months when I have time I'm going to look into how we as an agency can use React Native for small MVP projects to help clients get off the ground and get investment.

## Conclusion

TLDR; Have a look into React Native. But be aware that its not stable yet.
