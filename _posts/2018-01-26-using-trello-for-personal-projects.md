Have a lot of great ideas / tasks for your side project? Still keeping lists or spreadsheets of bugs or TODO's?

For my upcoming project, I've decided to try something different. Where I work we use Jira to keep a track of each project and task within that project. This is a little overkill for a side project. 

Enter Trello. Its free, and easy to set up. All you need to do is sign up for an account.

Once you've signed up and looked through the example board you'll probably have a really good idea of how it all works and what you're supposed to do. However, when I first looked at it, I began copying the setup we have at work. A swimlane for each status a task could be in. 

That got me thinking though, surely there could be a better way that takes advantage of Trello's ease of use and the ability to easily create new lists / swimlanes. Having recently looked at Monzo's [public Trello board](https://trello.com/b/9tcaMB4w/monzo-transparent-product-roadmap) (if you're not with [Monzo](https://monzo.com) for your current account - take a look), I decided to follow in their footsteps, along with a few modifications.

After a bit of playing around, I ended up with 4 swimlanes: 

### Ideas
In the ideas swimlane I added a card for every idea I had for the product. No matter how big or how small, it got added to a card and put in the ideas swimlane. The end result was a swimlane of about 20 cards. Some of the ideas were really complex and probably won't happen for a long time. Others were relatively simple and easy to implement.

### MVP
My second swimlane was called MVP which stands for Minimum Viable Product. This is a really slimmed down initial version of a product that you can get out quickly and is often used for idea vaidation before a more thorough / complete version is completed. In this swimlane, I added the bare minimum amount of cards from the idea column that I felt were crucial to an initial version of the product. I had to stop myself a few times and ask "Do users really need that?" "Is this feature actually a crucial part of the system?" Chances are, if you're asking yourself that about a feature. Its not.

### V2
Adding a V2 swimlane enabled me to think a bit further ahead. This is the version that would follow the MVP. Obviously, the project is going to change a lot between this initial planning period and the end of the MVP phase and beginning of the V2 phase. So this swimlane will be very fluid with ideas moving backwards and forwards between this swimlane and others. For my product, the initial plan for V2 consisted of adding most of the "nice to have" features that got axed from the MVP. I purposefully left it as quite a small list of features to make sure I had room to incorporate any user feedback.

### V3
Now we're talking. We're planning really far ahead. V3! Most of my own projects that I've worked on have barely seen MVP. Let alone V2 or V3. I'm hoping that spending a bit of time roadmapping features and planning it out into stages will help me to stay motivated. If you have a list of 10 tasks to do. Its going to feel like you're getting through it and keep you motivated as you check them off, compared to a list of 100 tasks. I found it quite hard to plan for V3 because I don't even know how people are going to react to the MVP or V2. I left V3 quite slim for this reason. Although, some of the tasks I added were quite ambitious and would require a lot of work. If I'm been brutally honest. I'll be happy if I even got that far. But lets stay positive!

With my swimlanes created and populated with tasks. I sat back and looked at it for a few minutes. It only took about half an hour, but already I'm estimating that there is about a years worth of work there. Not full time work. But my side project time. So about 3 - 5 hours per week. 

This is the first time that I've mapped a side project out. Or even taken the time to write down some of the tasks. But already, I feel like it has helped. It has set clear milestones that I can aim for. My current goal is to have the MVP version ready and live by the end of March. 

Once I have the MVP version out and a solid base to build upon. I plan on making my trello board public so people can follow my progress and see what is coming and when they can expect it.
