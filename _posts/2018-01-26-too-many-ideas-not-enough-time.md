title: "Too Many Ideas. Not Enough Time"

Having too many ideas for side projects and not enough time seems to be the problem of many developers. You hear more about people that have too many ideas and not enough time than you do of people that don't have any ideas.

A problem I really struggle with is seeing these ideas through to the end before getting another "better" idea and starting on that. I'm not sure if it has an actual name, but I know its a problem that I have. 

This blog is an example of such a thing. If you scroll back to the few posts before this one, you will see that they were originally published in Semptember 2017 Since then, I've written one post and thats the one prior to this one.

Just to be clear, anything from this point on is personal to me. It might be different for you, but I'd love to hear more.

There is no feeling like starting a new project. You're excited, you have so many great ideas for it and you have dreams of where it could take you. Then as you start working on it, you start to loose interest, or you've done all the fun bits that were challenging. Then you're just stuck with the bits that are boring or don't interest you as much. Its at this point that I start to struggle. 

Then BOOM! You have a new idea. You can't get that idea out of your head. You can manage 2 projects right? So you start working on the new idea. Then the same thing happens. You get stuck in a cycle of continuously starting projects and never finishing them. 

I'm sure a few of you reading this can relate. 

During the back end of 2017 I really started to become aware of this and as cheesy as it sounds. My goal in 2018 is to break the cycle and see something through to the end. I spent the first bit of January finding a project that I could work on and see through. 

I know what you're all thinking. Let me guess, its another attempt at blogging?

Well you're both right and wrong!

My plan for 2018 is to develop a single product. I'm going to use this blog as a place to collect my thoughts and document the processes I go through while building this product.

I could keep the product a total secret and build it in secret them launch it to the world. However, I think I'll have more chance of actually getting it to a point where it can be launched if I build it in public. 

If I'm constantly telling people what progress has been made each week, then I know for a fact that I won't want to type "I didn't actually do anything on it this week". That will drive me on.

Another benefit of documenting the entire process is idea validation along the way. If I say what feature I'm workig on in the upcoming weeks and people have ideas for it or don't like it. It will be easier to incorporate feedback at that point that it would when its become a integral feature to the product.

All right then, thats all well and good but whats the product?

All I can say for now is that all will be revealed in the next blog post. So keep an eye out for that.

What I will tell you now is that its going to be quite a big product. I've always liked the idea of building an entire platform. I know its a lot of work but thats okay. I want something that I can really get my teeth into and push what I'm capable of. 

Its not something that I'm going to be working full time on. I'll be working on this in my own time and when I can. Some weeks I'll do more than others. The main goal for me is to have something at the end of the year that I can prooperly launch and be happy with.
