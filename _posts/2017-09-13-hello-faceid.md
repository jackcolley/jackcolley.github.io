If you haven’t watched the Apple Event from last night here’s a quick TLDR. Loads of new awesome products.

One of the changes in the new iPhone X (pronounced iPhone 10) is the removal of TouchID and the home button all together. This is been replaced with something called FaceID.  From the demo we saw last night, you can use FaceID to do everything you could with TouchID. 

This got me thinking. Do we have to do anything different in our code to support FaceID and TouchID on other models. After doing a bit of digging around, it looks as though we won’t have to change anything in our code. iOS will just use FaceID in place of TouchID where needed. 

However, I should point out at this time there is little to no official documentation on FaceID as it was only announced around 16 hours ago at the time of me writing this.

However, one stat I was shocked at from last nights event was the chances of a random stranger been able to unlock your device with their fingerprints. It seemed like a surprisingly high number of people. Still very unlikely, however it’s more people that you would want. With FaceID Apple claim that this number will decrease to a 1 in 1 million chance that a random stranger could unlock your phone with their face. It’s probably worth pointing out that this was random strangers, not family members.

As a wrap up, I think the iPhone 8 and the iPhone X will be great additions to the market. I still would have liked TouchID on the iPhone X but if rumours are believed it was simply just too hard to make it work with the rest of the phone.
